# GoodDay
This is a simple weather app to present my coding skills in Swift.

## Orientation
I have include all dependent cocoa pods in this repo. Please use Xcode to open the GoodDay.xcworkspace.   

I have used the JSONExport to auto generate data models based on given JSON api repsonse.   
Models are automatically generated by ![JSONExport](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/JSONExport).  

I am using ![Alamofire](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Alamofire) pod for access API service.  

The ![ObjectMapper](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ObjectMapper) helps me to map decoded JSON object.
